    "my story":"I'm Ani Kitoshvili. I'm 25 years old. I was studying frontend development at Skillwill. Iâ€™ve already worked as a React developer in a project and I'm so motivated to work hard and develop my career as a developer. I worked with the group on the capstone project. We have created a website for the online market of handbags. I created the structure of the webpage with React. I was working on website styling. It should have been the same as what we had in the design. I have also been working on some functionality of the website that should work properly.",
